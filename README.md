# CrushIt

Ok here is the deal, I am currently developing a JavaScript intensive application <https://github.com/qawemlilo/nodebooks> and my front-end code is organised into modules of many different javaScript files. I wrote CrushIt so that I can easily compile and compress all scripts into one file that I can use in production without messing up my local development structure. 

# To Do

- Add css support
- Write better docs
- Add login options to scrap logged view
